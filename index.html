        Type coercion in JavaScript is a conversion of a value from one data type to another between string, number, and boolean.
        For examples, in JavaScript, 1 is equal (==) to '1' and is also equal (==) to true. But, both cases will false in Python as two values are not the same data types.<br /><br />
        <script>
          console.log("Problem 3)")
          console.log("1=='1' is", 1=='1')
          console.log("1==true is", 1==true);

        According to the course syllabus policy, any late or unreadable work will receive no point. There is no exception on making mistakes in submissions.
        However, five slip days are provided for students to use as deadline extensions and the lowest homework score will not be counted towards the final grade.
        Plus, each remaining slip day at the end of the semester will earn 0.4% of extra credit with a limit of 2% in total.
